 - We made a calculator, and we're going to refactor it
 - we want to reduce the code we write
 - Currently everything is under one method, we want to split it up
 - When refactoring you should look for 2 things:
      1: concepts that always go together - e.g., when calculating the mortgage.
      What do we need to know to calculate the mortgage?
      - we need the principal, monthly interest & no of payments
      - Monthly interest is calculated from the annual interest rate.
      - lets put the concept of calculating mortgage into a separate method.

      2: Repetitive patterns in code
      - e.g., the while loops have been repeated 3x.
      - the only thing different from the loops is;
      A - the validation message,
      B - the labels,
      C - values in the validation
      WE can refactor all of these

What's happening here?
1. User Input (Instance)
You are asking the user to enter:

Principal amount (the loan amount).

Annual Interest Rate (as a percentage).

Years (loan period in years).

This is done through the readNumber method using a
Scanner.

2. Calculating Mortgage (Instance)

- calculate the mortgage using the calculateMortgage
static method.

3. Formatting the Result (Instance)

ðŸ“£ Summary:
readNumber = Static method to get input safely.

calculateMortgage = Static method to calculate mortgage.

main = Static method where everything starts.

All these are static because we don't want to create
 objects â€” run the program directly.

Instance methods would need an object (like Employee
emp1 = new Employee()), but here, not necessary.

Type	          Keyword	            Called How?
Static method	static	       ClassName.methodName()
Instance method	(no static keyword)	objectName.methodName()
